# Google Earth Engine scripts
This Git Repository contaings Google Earth Engine scripts that I shared publicly.

The scripts perform variety of tasks, asuch as flood water animation reation with Sentinel1 SAR images, Timelapse GIF creation, Land Use/:and COver analysis etc.

Copy and paste the code from the reposity to Google Earth Engine code editor and run.

The same sprits are also availabe in Google Earth Engine code base.
